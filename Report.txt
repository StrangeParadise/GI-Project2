Our game is basically a third person game that allows the player to control the
ball to pass through all the obstacles and overcome the harsh situation that
the environment bring to the ball and finally achieve the goal which is get to
the destination. Regarding to instruction for this game, we have a very simple
and user-friendly UI for the player which can tap 'Start' on the Menu Scene
which is the first scene the player will see. The scene will be changed to the
game scene as soon as the player tap the 'Start' button. It is very
straightforwared to play and control the ball. We have 'W'/UpArrow for
rolling forward, 'A'/LeftArrow for rolling left, 'S'/DownArrow for rolling back
and 'D'/RightArrow for rolling right. Since we are can only control the ball
and our game is designed to be a three dimensional game, we have 'Q' and 'E' to
help player to adjust the perspective from the ball. By pressing 'Q', the perspective
will be turned right hand side and the perspective will be turned to the left
by pressing 'E'. We have designed different types of ball which has been made up of
different varieties of material such as wooden, iron, bronze, fire and so on to
make the player have more choice to play the game. Different balls have
different attribute which significantly affects their speed and friction. To change the ball
during the game, just simply press 'C'. There are some harsh situation during
the gameplay, for instance, climbing a uphill road or go over the traps. Then
what we need to do is accelarate the ball by keeping pressing 'SHIFT' and
'W'/UpArrow. 

How you modelled objects and entities?

Those different types of balls are stored as many prefabs and it is easier to utilize when making the function of changing the ball type. The game map is generated by a CSV file. We read the data in the file and using our mapGenerator script to generate a map in the unity scene as a single game object.

How you handled the graphics pipeline and camera motion?

Our camera is sticked with the ball in a constant distance and by pressing 'Q' or 'E' button, the camera will rotate around the ball as the central 90 degrees clockwise and ani-clockwise respectivly. 

There are three different types of shaders have been utilized in our game. They
are Phong shader, Disappear shader and Vibrate Shader.

Phong shader is used to help adjust the ambient, diffuse and specular to make
the game much more realistic. Disappear shader is created for some special mode
which means that the player can only see the environment several seconds and
the whole environment will disappear for 1-2 seconds iteratively so that we
make the game a bit harder to play and bring some fresh idea to the player.
Talking about the Vibrate shader used in this game, we used it on the words and
the button since the whole environment we make is in the universe and it all
happens in some different gravity environment. Therefore, we prefer that the
words and the button is sometimes not stable and even shaking and falling apart
to make it much more real and interesting.

Decription of the querying and observational methods used, including: 1) description of the participants (how many, demographics) , description of the methodology (which techniques did you use, what did you have participants do, how did you record the data) , and feedback gathered.

The participants are all Uni students and we found 6 participants to play our game. We used the que. There are 4 participants
