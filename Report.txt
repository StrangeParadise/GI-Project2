Our game is basically a first person game that allows the player to control the
ball to pass through all the obstacles and overcome the harsh situation that
the environment bring to the ball and finally achieve the goal which is get to
the destination. Regarding to instruction for this game, we have a very simple
and user-friendly UI for the player which can tap 'Start' on the Menu Scene
which is the first scene the player will see. The scene will be changed to the
game scene as soon as the player tap the 'Start' button. It is very
straightforwared to play and control the ball. We have 'w'/UpArrow for
rolling forward, 'a'/LeftArrow for rolling left, 's'/DownArrow for rolling back
and 'd'/RightArrow for rolling right. Since we are can only control the ball
and our game is designed to be a three dimensional game, we have 'q' and 'e' to
help player to adjust the perspective from the ball. By pressing 'q', the whole
screen will be turned right hand side and the screen will be turned to the left
by pressing 'e'. We have designed different types of ball which has been made up of
different varieties of material such as wooden, iron, bronze, fire and so on to
make the player have more choice to play the game. Different balls have
different attribute which significantly affects their speed. To change the ball
during the game, just simply press 'c'. There are some harsh situation during
the gameplay, for instance, climbing a uphill road or go over the traps. Then
what we need to do is accelarate the ball by keeping pressing 'SHIFT' and
'w'/UpArrow. 

How you modelled objects and entities?
How you handled the graphics pipeline and camera motion?

There are three different types of shaders have been utilized in our game. They
are Phong shader, Disappear shader and Toon Shader.
Phong shader is used to help adjust the ambient, diffuse and specular to make
the game much more realistic. Disappear shader is created for some special mode
which means that the player can only see the environment several seconds and
the whole environment will disappear for 1-2 seconds iteratively so that we
make the game a bit more hard to play and bring some fresh idea to the player.
Talking about the toon shader used in this game, we used it on the words and
the button since the whole environment we make is in the universe and it all
happens in some different gravity environment. Therefore, we prefer that the
words and the button is sometimes not stable and even shaking and falling apart
to make it much more real and interesting.
